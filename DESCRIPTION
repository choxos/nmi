Description: Implements the Network Meta-Interpolation (NMI) methodology
    for addressing effect modification in network meta-analysis using subgroup
    analyses. The method interpolates treatment effects at desired covariate
    levels using individual patient data and aggregate data. Version 1.2.0 adds
    mixed effect modifier support (binary + continuous), multiple continuous EMs
    with multivariate interpolation, advanced validation, and cross-validation 
    methods. Based on the method described in Harari et al. (2023) "Network 
    meta-interpolation: Effect modification adjustment in network meta-analysis 
    using subgroup analyses".
