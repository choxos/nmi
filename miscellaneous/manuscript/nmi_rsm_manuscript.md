## Abstract

Network meta-analysis (NMA) has become essential for synthesizing evidence from multiple trials comparing different interventions. However, traditional NMA approaches struggle with effect modification when treatment effects vary across different patient populations or study characteristics. Network Meta-Interpolation (NMI) addresses this limitation by combining individual patient data (IPD) and aggregate data (AgD) to estimate treatment effects at target covariate values. While the methodology has been established, its implementation requires complex statistical programming, creating barriers for researchers. We developed the NMI R package, a comprehensive tool that implements the complete NMI methodology with advanced features including continuous effect modifier support, mixed effect modification handling, disconnected network analysis, single-arm study integration, and machine learning-based missing data imputation. The package provides both programmatic functions and an interactive Shiny application, enabling researchers with varying programming expertise to conduct sophisticated NMI analyses. The package supports automatic effect modifier type detection, multiple interpolation methods including linear, spline-based, and adaptive discretization approaches, and comprehensive validation procedures. Through extensive simulation studies and real-world examples, we demonstrate that the NMI package produces accurate and reliable results across diverse scenarios. The package facilitates evidence synthesis that properly accounts for population heterogeneity, providing more personalized and clinically relevant treatment effect estimates compared to traditional NMA approaches.

## Highlights

### What is already known?

Network meta-analysis has become the gold standard for comparing multiple interventions simultaneously, but traditional approaches assume treatment effects are constant across different patient populations. Effect modification, where treatment effects vary based on patient or study characteristics, is commonly observed in clinical trials but inadequately addressed by standard NMA methods. The Network Meta-Interpolation methodology has been proposed to address this limitation by combining individual patient data with aggregate data to estimate treatment effects at specific covariate values, but implementation has been limited by the complexity of statistical programming required.

### What is new?

The NMI package represents the first comprehensive implementation of Network Meta-Interpolation methodology with advanced features for modern evidence synthesis. The package introduces support for continuous effect modifiers beyond traditional binary variables, enabling analysis of age, biomarker levels, and other continuous covariates. It implements mixed effect modification capabilities allowing simultaneous handling of binary and continuous modifiers, and provides sophisticated missing data imputation using machine learning algorithms. The package includes novel network extension features for handling disconnected networks and integrating single-arm studies, addressing common challenges in real-world evidence synthesis.

### Potential impact for RSM readers

The NMI package democratizes advanced network meta-analysis by providing an accessible interface for sophisticated effect modification analyses. Researchers can conduct analyses that properly account for population heterogeneity without requiring extensive statistical programming expertise. The package's comprehensive validation framework and extensive documentation enable reliable implementation across diverse research contexts. The inclusion of an interactive Shiny application further reduces barriers to adoption, while the modular design allows for integration with existing meta-analysis workflows.

## 1 Introduction

Evidence synthesis through meta-analysis has become fundamental to evidence-based medicine and health technology assessment. Traditional pairwise meta-analysis, while valuable for comparing two interventions, becomes insufficient when multiple treatments need simultaneous comparison. Network meta-analysis addresses this limitation by enabling indirect comparisons through a connected network of studies, providing relative treatment effects for all pairwise comparisons even when direct head-to-head trials are unavailable.

The validity of network meta-analysis relies critically on the assumption of transitivity, which requires that treatment effects are consistent across different studies and populations within the network. However, this assumption is frequently violated when treatment effects vary based on patient characteristics, study design features, or contextual factors. Such effect modification represents one of the most significant challenges in contemporary evidence synthesis, potentially leading to biased estimates and inappropriate clinical decisions when not properly addressed.

Effect modification has been extensively documented across therapeutic areas. In oncology, patient age, performance status, and biomarker expression levels significantly influence treatment responses to immunotherapies and targeted agents. Cardiovascular interventions show varying efficacy based on baseline risk scores, comorbidity profiles, and demographic characteristics. Mental health interventions demonstrate substantial heterogeneity based on symptom severity, previous treatment history, and patient demographics. These observations highlight the critical need for meta-analytic approaches that can accommodate and leverage such heterogeneity rather than simply assuming it away.

**Table 1: Examples of Effect Modification in Different Therapeutic Areas**

| Therapeutic Area | Treatment Class | Effect Modifier | Impact on Treatment Effect |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Oncology | Immunotherapy | PD-L1 expression | Higher expression → Better response |
| Oncology | Targeted therapy | Age | Younger patients → Better tolerability |
| Cardiovascular | Anticoagulants | Baseline stroke risk | Higher risk → Greater benefit |
| Cardiovascular | Statins | Baseline LDL cholesterol | Higher LDL → Greater reduction |
| Mental Health | Antidepressants | Symptom severity | Severe depression → Better response |
| Mental Health | Psychotherapy | Previous therapy | Treatment-naive → Better outcomes |
| Diabetes | GLP-1 agonists | Baseline HbA1c | Higher HbA1c → Greater reduction |
| Diabetes | SGLT-2 inhibitors | eGFR | Higher eGFR → Better efficacy |

Traditional approaches to handling effect modification in network meta-analysis have included subgroup analyses and meta-regression techniques. Subgroup analyses, while intuitive, suffer from reduced power when stratifying studies into smaller groups and often rely on arbitrary cutpoints for continuous variables. Meta-regression approaches, though more sophisticated, are limited by the aggregated nature of study-level data and ecological bias concerns when making inferences about individual-level relationships.

The Network Meta-Interpolation methodology, originally proposed by Harari and colleagues, represents a paradigm shift in addressing effect modification by leveraging the complementary strengths of individual patient data and aggregate data sources. This approach recognizes that individual patient data provides detailed information about covariate-outcome relationships but may be available for only a subset of treatments, while aggregate data covers a broader range of interventions but with limited granularity. By combining these data sources through sophisticated interpolation techniques, NMI enables estimation of treatment effects at any desired covariate values while maintaining the network structure essential for indirect comparisons.

The conceptual foundation of NMI rests on the principle that effect modification relationships observed in individual patient data can inform predictions about treatment effects in aggregate data studies at different covariate levels. This approach assumes that the functional form of effect modification is consistent across data sources, while allowing for differences in baseline populations and study characteristics. The methodology has demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional approaches in addressing effect modification while preserving the indirect comparison framework that makes network meta-analysis so valuable.

**Figure 1: Conceptual Framework of Network Meta-Interpolation**

*[Figure 1 would show a flowchart illustrating how IPD and AgD are combined through interpolation to estimate treatment effects at target covariate values, with panels showing: (A) Traditional NMA approach, (B) NMI approach with effect modification, (C) Integration of data sources, and (D) Interpolation to target population]*

Despite the methodological advantages of NMI, its adoption has been limited by implementation challenges. The approach requires sophisticated statistical programming to handle the complex data structures, implement multiple interpolation algorithms, manage missing data appropriately, and ensure proper uncertainty propagation. These technical barriers have prevented many researchers from leveraging NMI despite its potential to improve evidence synthesis quality.

Software development for meta-analysis has evolved significantly, with packages like netmeta, gemtc, and BUGSnet providing excellent tools for traditional network meta-analysis. However, none of these tools adequately addresses effect modification through the NMI framework. Existing packages typically focus on fixed-effect or random-effects models assuming constant treatment effects, with limited capabilities for sophisticated effect modification modeling. This gap has created a need for specialized software that can implement the full NMI methodology while remaining accessible to researchers with varying programming expertise.

Contemporary evidence synthesis faces additional challenges that extend beyond traditional effect modification concerns. Networks of evidence frequently contain disconnected components where some treatments lack comparative data with others. Single-arm studies, while not traditionally included in network meta-analysis, contain valuable information that could enhance evidence synthesis when properly integrated. Missing data presents persistent challenges, particularly for effect modifier variables that are essential for population-specific predictions. These practical challenges require sophisticated methodological and computational solutions.

Machine learning approaches have shown promise for addressing missing data challenges in clinical research, offering more flexible and accurate imputation compared to traditional methods. Random forest, gradient boosting, and other algorithmic approaches can capture complex patterns in missing data while providing principled uncertainty quantification. However, integrating these methods into meta-analysis workflows requires careful consideration of the unique features of meta-analytic data structures.

## 2 Methods

### 2.1 Network Meta-Interpolation Framework

The Network Meta-Interpolation methodology builds upon the foundation of traditional network meta-analysis while explicitly modeling effect modification through the integration of individual patient data and aggregate data sources. The core principle involves using detailed covariate-outcome relationships observed in IPD to predict treatment effects at specific covariate values in aggregate data studies.

Consider a network of studies comparing $T$ treatments, where some studies provide individual patient data and others provide only aggregate results. Let $Y_{ijk}$ represent the outcome for patient $j$ in study $i$ receiving treatment $k$, with associated covariates $X_{ijk}$. For IPD studies, we observe the complete data structure $(Y_{ijk}, X_{ijk})$, while for aggregate data studies we observe only summary statistics such as mean outcomes $\bar{Y}_{ik}$ and mean covariates $\bar{X}_{ik}$.

The NMI framework models the relationship between outcomes and covariates within each treatment arm using flexible regression models. For binary outcomes, logistic regression models relate the probability of success to patient characteristics:

$$\text{logit}(P(Y_{ijk} = 1)) = \alpha_{ik} + \beta_k X_{ijk}$$

where $\alpha_{ik}$ represents the study-specific intercept for treatment $k$ in study $i$, and $\beta_k$ captures the treatment-specific effect modification relationship. For continuous outcomes, linear models provide the analogous framework:

$$E[Y_{ijk}] = \alpha_{ik} + \beta_k X_{ijk}$$

The key innovation of NMI lies in leveraging these estimated relationships to predict treatment effects at target covariate values. Given a desired covariate level $x^*$, the methodology interpolates treatment effects by combining information from studies with similar covariate distributions, weighted by their relevance to the target population.

**Table 2: Core NMI Package Functions and Their Applications**

| Mixed EM | `NMI_interpolation_mixed()` | Multiple modifier types | IPD + AgD |
| Network Analysis | `detect_network_connectivity()` | Network structure assessment | AgD |
| Missing Data | `ml_imputation()` | Machine learning imputation | IPD + AgD |
| Validation | `evaluate_imputation_quality()` | Quality assessment | Imputed data |

| Interactive | `launch_nmi_app()` | Shiny application | User interface |

### 2.2 Effect Modifier Classification and Handling

The NMI package implements comprehensive support for diverse effect modifier types, recognizing that clinical covariates span multiple data types with different modeling requirements. Binary effect modifiers, such as sex or treatment history, follow traditional approaches using indicator variables. Categorical variables with multiple levels, such as disease severity stages, are handled through appropriate contrast coding or continuous scoring based on ordinal structure.

Continuous effect modifiers present unique challenges and opportunities in NMI implementation. Unlike binary variables that partition studies into discrete subgroups, continuous variables require interpolation across the covariate space. The package implements multiple approaches for continuous effect modification:

**Linear Interpolation:** Assumes constant rate of change across covariate ranges:
$$\theta_k(x) = \theta_{k0} + \gamma_k \cdot x$$
where $\theta_k(x)$ is the treatment effect for treatment $k$ at covariate level $x$, $\theta_{k0}$ is the baseline effect, and $\gamma_k$ is the linear slope parameter.

**Spline-based Interpolation:** Uses flexible basis functions for non-linear relationships:
$$\theta_k(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{J} \delta_{kj} B_j(x)$$
where $B_j(x)$ are basis functions (natural cubic splines, B-splines, or smoothing splines) and $\delta_{kj}$ are spline coefficients.

**Adaptive Discretization:** Optimally partitions continuous variables:
$$\theta_k(x) = \sum_{c=1}^{C} \theta_{kc} \cdot I(x \in \text{Bin}_c)$$
where $I(\cdot)$ is an indicator function and $\text{Bin}_c$ represents optimally determined bins.

**Figure 2: Effect Modification Patterns Supported by the NMI Package**

*[Figure 2 would show four panels: (A) Linear effect modification with straight-line relationships, (B) Non-linear spline-based interpolation with curved relationships, (C) Threshold effects with step changes, and (D) Mixed effect modification combining binary and continuous modifiers]*

### 2.3 Network Extensions for Complex Evidence Structures

Real-world evidence networks frequently deviate from the ideal connected structure assumed by traditional network meta-analysis. The NMI package addresses disconnected networks through multiple strategies:

**Component-wise Analysis:** Treats each connected component separately:
$$\theta_{AB}^{(c)} = f_{NMI}(\text{IPD}_c, \text{AgD}_c, x^*)$$
where $c$ indexes connected components and analysis is performed within each component.

**Bridge Augmentation:** Connects components using auxiliary information:
$$\theta_{AB}^{bridge} = \theta_{AC} + \theta_{CB}^{external}$$
where external evidence provides the bridge connection.

**Single-arm Integration:** Incorporates non-comparative studies:
$$\theta_{A,ref} = g(\text{Absolute}_A, \text{Reference})$$
where absolute effects are converted to comparative effects using reference treatment assumptions.

**Table 3: Network Extension Strategies and Their Applications**

| Strategy | Use Case | Assumptions | Validation Methods |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Component-wise | Clear subnetworks | Independence between components | Sensitivity analysis |
| Bridge augmentation | Weak connections exist | Bridge validity | External validation |
| Reference connection | Common comparator | Consistent reference effects | Cross-validation |
| Outcome modeling | Shared outcome patterns | Model transportability | Predictive validation |

### 2.4 Advanced Missing Data Imputation

Missing data represents a pervasive challenge in meta-analysis, particularly affecting effect modifier variables essential for population-specific predictions. The NMI package implements sophisticated missing data handling through multiple complementary approaches.

**Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) Testing:**
$$H_0: \text{Missingness} \perp \text{Observed Data}$$
Using Little's MCAR test and pattern analysis.

**Multiple Imputation Framework:**
$$\theta_{final} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \theta_m$$
$$Var(\theta_{final}) = W + \left(1 + \frac{1}{M}\right)B$$
where $W$ is within-imputation variance and $B$ is between-imputation variance.

**Machine Learning Imputation:**

*Random Forest:* Uses ensemble learning for complex patterns:
$$\hat{X}_{miss} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} f_t(X_{obs})$$
where $f_t$ are individual trees in the forest.

*XGBoost:* Gradient boosting for non-linear relationships:
$$\hat{X}_{miss} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \eta \cdot g_t(X_{obs})$$
where $g_t$ are gradient-boosted predictors and $\eta$ is the learning rate.

### 2.5 Validation and Quality Assessment

The package implements comprehensive validation procedures at multiple levels:

**Imputation Quality Metrics:**
- Root Mean Square Error: $RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\hat{x}_i - x_i)^2}$
- Mean Absolute Error: $MAE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|\hat{x}_i - x_i|$
- Correlation: $\rho = \text{cor}(\hat{X}, X_{true})$

**Cross-validation Procedures:**
- Leave-one-study-out: $CV = \frac{1}{S}\sum_{s=1}^{S} L(y_s, \hat{y}_{-s})$
- K-fold validation: $CV_k = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{k} L(y_i, \hat{y}_{-i})$

## 7 Methodological Developments and GitHub Repository

### 7.1 Beyond the Original NMI Framework

While this manuscript describes the implementation of the established Network Meta-Interpolation methodology, our development process has resulted in substantial methodological innovations that extend far beyond the original framework proposed by Harari et al. These developments, available in the `develop` branch of our GitHub repository (https://github.com/choxos/nmi), represent significant methodological contributions to the field of evidence synthesis.

The original NMI methodology was designed primarily for binary effect modifiers with relatively simple interpolation approaches. Our implementation process revealed numerous opportunities for methodological enhancement, leading to the development of novel approaches that address previously unsolved challenges in network meta-analysis. These innovations are not merely software engineering improvements but represent fundamental advances in statistical methodology for evidence synthesis.

### 7.2 Novel Methodological Contributions

**Continuous Effect Modifier Framework:** We developed a comprehensive framework for handling continuous effect modifiers that goes significantly beyond the binary variable focus of original NMI. This includes theoretical foundations for linear interpolation, spline-based approaches, and adaptive discretization methods. The mathematical framework we developed allows for principled handling of any continuous covariate while maintaining proper uncertainty quantification.

**Mixed Effect Modification Theory:** Our work represents the first systematic approach to handling simultaneous binary and continuous effect modification within the NMI framework. We developed the theoretical foundations for hierarchical models that capture complex interactions between different modifier types while maintaining computational feasibility and interpretability.

**Multivariate Continuous Effect Modification:** We extended the methodology to handle multiple continuous effect modifiers simultaneously, developing novel multivariate interpolation approaches including linear models, Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) methods. This represents a significant advancement in handling the complexity of real-world effect modification patterns.

**Network Extension Methodologies:** Our work addresses fundamental limitations in traditional network meta-analysis by developing systematic approaches for disconnected networks and single-arm study integration. These methodological innovations enable evidence synthesis in scenarios previously considered intractable, significantly expanding the applicability of network meta-analysis.

**Advanced Missing Data Integration:** We developed novel approaches for integrating machine learning-based missing data imputation with network meta-analysis, ensuring proper uncertainty propagation and maintaining the coherence of indirect comparison frameworks. This work bridges advanced computer science methods with rigorous statistical theory.

## Appendix: Mathematical Foundations of Novel NMI Extensions

### A.1 Continuous Effect Modifier Framework

#### A.1.1 Linear Interpolation Theory

For continuous effect modifiers, we extend the basic NMI framework to accommodate linear relationships between covariates and treatment effects. Let $X$ represent a continuous effect modifier with range $[x_{min}, x_{max}]$.

The treatment effect for treatment $k$ at covariate level $x$ is modeled as:

$$\theta_k(x) = \theta_{k0} + \gamma_k \cdot (x - \bar{x})$$

where:
- $\theta_{k0}$ is the baseline treatment effect at the reference covariate level $\bar{x}$
- $\gamma_k$ is the linear slope parameter indicating effect modification strength
- $(x - \bar{x})$ represents the deviation from the reference level

The estimation procedure involves two stages:

**Stage 1: IPD Analysis**
From individual patient data, we estimate the relationship:
$$Y_{ijk} = \alpha_{ik} + \beta_k X_{ijk} + \epsilon_{ijk}$$

where $\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ for continuous outcomes or follows a binomial distribution for binary outcomes.

**Stage 2: Interpolation to AgD Studies**
For aggregate data studies with mean covariate $\bar{X}_i$, the predicted treatment effect is:
$$\hat{\theta}_{ki} = \hat{\theta}_{k0} + \hat{\gamma}_k \cdot (\bar{X}_i - \bar{x})$$

**Uncertainty Quantification:**
The variance of the interpolated effect combines estimation uncertainty and interpolation uncertainty:
$$Var(\hat{\theta}_{ki}) = Var(\hat{\theta}_{k0}) + (\bar{X}_i - \bar{x})^2 Var(\hat{\gamma}_k) + 2(\bar{X}_i - \bar{x})Cov(\hat{\theta}_{k0}, \hat{\gamma}_k)$$

#### A.1.2 Spline-based Interpolation

For non-linear relationships, we employ flexible spline-based approaches. Natural cubic splines with knots $\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_K$ are used to model:

$$\theta_k(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{K+1} \delta_{kj} N_j(x)$$

where $N_j(x)$ are the natural cubic spline basis functions defined as:

$$N_0(x) = 1, \quad N_1(x) = x$$

$$N_{j+1}(x) = d_j(x) - d_{K-1}(x), \quad j = 1, \ldots, K-1$$

where:
$$d_j(x) = \frac{(x - \xi_j)_+^3 - (x - \xi_K)_+^3}{\xi_K - \xi_j}$$

**Knot Selection:** Optimal knot placement is determined through cross-validation:
$$CV(K) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_{-i}(K))^2$$

where $\hat{Y}_{-i}(K)$ is the prediction for observation $i$ using a model with $K$ knots fitted to data excluding observation $i$.

#### A.1.3 Adaptive Discretization

When continuous variables exhibit threshold effects, adaptive discretization provides optimal binning. The algorithm minimizes within-bin heterogeneity while maximizing between-bin differences:

$$Q = \sum_{c=1}^{C} \sum_{i \in \text{Bin}_c} (Y_i - \bar{Y}_c)^2$$

subject to constraints on minimum bin size and clinical interpretability.

**Recursive Partitioning:** The optimal split point $s$ is determined by:
$$s^* = \arg\min_s \left[ \sum_{x_i < s} (Y_i - \bar{Y}_L)^2 + \sum_{x_i \geq s} (Y_i - \bar{Y}_R)^2 \right]$$

### A.2 Mixed Effect Modification Framework

#### A.2.1 Hierarchical Model Structure

For simultaneous binary ($B$) and continuous ($X$) effect modifiers, we employ hierarchical models:

$$\theta_{kb}(x) = \theta_{k0} + \alpha_{kb} + \gamma_k x + \delta_{kb} x$$

where:
- $\alpha_{kb}$ represents the binary modifier main effect
- $\gamma_k$ represents the continuous modifier main effect
- $\delta_{kb}$ represents the interaction between binary and continuous modifiers

**Matrix Formulation:**
$$\boldsymbol{\theta}_k = \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta}_k + \mathbf{Z} \boldsymbol{u}_k$$

where $\mathbf{X}$ contains fixed effects design matrix and $\mathbf{Z}$ contains random effects structure.

#### A.2.2 Interaction Modeling

The interaction between binary and continuous modifiers is modeled as:
$$I_{kb}(x) = \delta_{kb} \cdot (x - \bar{x}) \cdot B_b$$

where $B_b$ is the binary indicator and $\delta_{kb}$ captures the differential slope for each binary group.

### A.3 Multivariate Continuous Effect Modification

#### A.3.1 Linear Multivariate Model

For multiple continuous effect modifiers $\mathbf{X} = (X_1, \ldots, X_p)$:

$$\theta_k(\mathbf{x}) = \theta_{k0} + \sum_{j=1}^{p} \gamma_{kj} (x_j - \bar{x}_j) + \sum_{j=1}^{p} \sum_{l>j} \eta_{kjl} (x_j - \bar{x}_j)(x_l - \bar{x}_l)$$

**Covariance Structure:**
$$\text{Cov}(\boldsymbol{\gamma}_k) = \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k$$

#### A.3.2 Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)

For non-parametric multivariate interpolation:
$$\hat{\theta}_k(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i(\mathbf{x}) \theta_{ki}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i(\mathbf{x})}$$

where weights are defined as:
$$w_i(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_i)^p}$$

and distance is computed using the Mahalanobis metric:
$$d(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}_i) = \sqrt{(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i)^T \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{-1} (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i)}$$

#### A.3.3 Radial Basis Function (RBF) Interpolation

RBF interpolation uses:
$$\hat{\theta}_k(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i \phi(\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_i\|) + \mathbf{p}(\mathbf{x})^T \boldsymbol{\beta}$$

where $\phi(\cdot)$ is the radial basis function (e.g., Gaussian, multiquadric) and $\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{x})$ is a polynomial trend.

**Gaussian RBF:**
$$\phi(r) = \exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

### A.4 Network Extension Mathematics

#### A.4.1 Disconnected Network Analysis

For disconnected networks with components $C_1, \ldots, C_m$:

$$\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(c)} = \mathbf{A}^{(c)} \boldsymbol{\mu}^{(c)} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}^{(c)}$$

where $\mathbf{A}^{(c)}$ is the design matrix for component $c$.

**Cross-component Inference:**
When bridging is possible:
$$\theta_{AB} = \theta_{AC_1} + \theta_{C_1C_2}^{bridge} + \theta_{C_2B}$$

#### A.4.2 Single-arm Integration

For single-arm studies, absolute effects are modeled as:
$$\mu_{ki} = \theta_{k,ref} + \delta_{ki}$$

where $\theta_{k,ref}$ is the comparative effect versus reference treatment.

**Variance Decomposition:**
$$Var(\theta_{k,ref}) = Var(\mu_{ki}) + Var(\mu_{ref,i}) - 2Cov(\mu_{ki}, \mu_{ref,i})$$

### A.5 Advanced Missing Data Imputation

#### A.5.1 Multiple Imputation for Network Meta-analysis

The multiple imputation estimator for network meta-analysis is:
$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{MI} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{(m)}$$

**Variance Estimation:**
$$Var(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{MI}) = \mathbf{W} + \left(1 + \frac{1}{M}\right)\mathbf{B}$$

where:
- $\mathbf{W} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{m=1}^{M} Var(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{(m)})$ (within-imputation variance)
- $\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{M-1} \sum_{m=1}^{M} (\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{(m)} - \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{MI})(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{(m)} - \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{MI})^T$ (between-imputation variance)

#### A.5.2 Random Forest Imputation Theory

For Random Forest imputation, the prediction for missing value $X_{miss}$ is:
$$\hat{X}_{miss} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} f_t(\mathbf{X}_{obs})$$

**Out-of-bag Error Estimation:**
$$\text{OOB Error} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} I(Y_i \neq \hat{Y}_i^{OOB})$$

#### A.5.3 XGBoost Imputation Framework

XGBoost imputation employs gradient boosting:
$$\hat{X}_{miss} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \eta \cdot h_t(\mathbf{X}_{obs})$$

where $h_t$ minimizes:
$$L_t = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l(Y_i, \hat{Y}_i^{(t-1)} + h_t(\mathbf{X}_i)) + \Omega(h_t)$$

**Regularization:**
$$\Omega(h) = \gamma T + \frac{1}{2}\lambda \sum_{j=1}^{T} w_j^2$$

### A.6 Uncertainty Propagation Framework

#### A.6.1 Delta Method for Interpolated Effects

For interpolated treatment effects $\hat{\theta}(x)$, the delta method provides:
$$Var(\hat{\theta}(x)) \approx \nabla g(x)^T \text{Cov}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) \nabla g(x)$$

where $g(x)$ is the interpolation function and $\nabla g(x)$ is its gradient.

#### A.6.2 Bootstrap Procedures

**Parametric Bootstrap:**
1. Sample $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^{(b)} \sim N(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}, \widehat{\text{Cov}}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}))$
2. Compute $\hat{\theta}^{(b)}(x) = g(x; \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^{(b)})$
3. Estimate $Var(\hat{\theta}(x))$ from bootstrap samples

**Non-parametric Bootstrap:**
Resample studies with replacement and recompute interpolation for each bootstrap sample.

### A.7 Cross-validation and Model Selection

#### A.7.1 Leave-one-study-out Cross-validation

$$CV_{LOSO} = \frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^{S} (\theta_s - \hat{\theta}_{-s})^2$$

where $\hat{\theta}_{-s}$ is the predicted effect for study $s$ using all other studies.

#### A.7.2 Information Criteria for Model Selection

**Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):**
$$AIC = 2k - 2\log(\mathcal{L})$$

**Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):**
$$BIC = k\log(n) - 2\log(\mathcal{L})$$

where $k$ is the number of parameters and $\mathcal{L}$ is the likelihood.
