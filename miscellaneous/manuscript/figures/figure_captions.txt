Figure 2. Effect Modification Patterns Supported by the NMI Package. The package handles diverse effect modification relationships including linear patterns with constant slopes, non-linear patterns using spline-based interpolation, threshold effects with step changes, and mixed patterns combining multiple modifier types.

Figure 3A. Mean Absolute Bias vs Missing Data Percentage. NMI maintains superior performance through ML-based imputation while other methods show substantial degradation with complete case analysis.

Figure 3B. Coverage Rate vs Missing Data Percentage. NMI demonstrates robust coverage probability even with substantial missing data, while traditional methods show marked deterioration.

Figure 4A. Performance by Effect Modification Pattern. NMI consistently achieves the lowest bias across all effect modification types, while traditional NMA fails catastrophically when effect modification is present.

Figure 4B. Method Rankings by Scenario. NMI consistently ranks first across all effect modification patterns, demonstrating superior adaptability to diverse analytical scenarios.

Figure 5A. Bias vs RMSE Trade-off. The scatter plot demonstrates NMI's superior position in the accuracy landscape, achieving both lower bias and lower RMSE compared to alternative methods.

Figure 5B. Overall Performance Scores. Normalized performance metrics across bias, RMSE, coverage, and computational speed demonstrate NMI's balanced excellence across all evaluation criteria.

Figure 6. Comprehensive Performance Heatmap. Higher scores (greener colors) indicate better performance across all metrics, with NMI showing consistent excellence across the evaluation framework.
